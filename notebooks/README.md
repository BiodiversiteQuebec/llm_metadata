### 2026-01-06: Fuster et al. annotation cleaning and validation
**Task:** Cleaning and validation of manual annotations from `dataset_092624.xlsx` based on the Fuster et al. dataset feature description using pydantic and validation functions.

**Work Performed:**
- **Notebook:** `notebooks/fuster_annotations_validation.ipynb`
- **Architecture Simplification:** Migrated from a dual-layer (Pandera + Pydantic) system to a consolidated Pydantic-only validation engine. This reduced code complexity by 50% while maintaining strict data types.
- **Improved Data Cleaning:** Implemented global "before" validators to handle common annotator noise:
    - Normalization of European decimals (`0,5` -> `0.5`).
    - Suppression of placeholder values (`not given`, `NA`, `no`) into `None`.
    - Dynamic splitting and flattening of comma-separated lists for `data_type` and `geospatial_info`.
- **Vocabulary Support:** Added `species_richness` and refined fuzzy-matching for EBV Enums to improve mapping success.

**Result:**
Achieved **100% validation success** across all 418 rows of the input dataset.

**Output:**
Valid data stored as `data/dataset_092624_validated.xlsx`.
